Hi Team,

Both jobs that failed at 06:15 are scripts that send logs to SG_Monitoring.
Based on the logs, the failure was due to a temporary network issue while trying to reach Elasticsearch.

The issue seems to have resolved itself, as the following runs completed successfully.

Let me know if further investigation is needed.

Best regards,
Anoua
